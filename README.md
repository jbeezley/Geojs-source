# Introducing GeoJS

GeoJS is a new javascript library for visualizing geospatial data in the browser.  It is completely open source and hosted at https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs.

# API Overview

GeoJS  is supported by a hierarchy of classes which define basic interfaces for the objects used in the API.  The entry point for developer interaction with the API is the `geo.map` class.  As with most object constructors in GeoJS, the map constructor takes an object containing optional parameters.
```javascript
var map = geo.map(
    {
        "node":   "#map",     # The DOM node to contain the map
        "center": [40, -100], # The initial center point
        "zoom":   2           # The initial zoom level
    }
);
```
The map can then be used to generate one or more layers that contain content visible to the end user.



# Objects and events

The lowest level class that all other classes inherit from is the core `geo.object` which provides all objects with a timekeeping mechanism as well as providing the interface for the internal events system.  Another important base class is the `geo.sceneObject` from which all drawable objects are derived.  The `sceneObject` defines a tree structure through which events are propagated.  All events in the scene tree first propagate up the tree from parent to parent until it reaches the root node.  Once the event reaches the root, the node calls its own handlers and then triggers the event on all of its children.  Parent nodes can block events from propagating up the scene tree as well as prevent its children from receiving events that originated from a different branch.
